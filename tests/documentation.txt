PARSER TEST DOCUMENTATION

There can be multiple tests per file. Each test must begin with a line that says
"#data". All subsequent lines until "#errors" are the test data and must be
passed to the system being tested unchanged, except with the final newline (on
the last line) removed. Then there must be a line that says "#errors:". It must
be followed by one line per parse error that a conformant checker would return.
It doesn't matter what those lines are, the only thing that matters is that
there be the right number of parse errors. Then there must be a line that says
"#document", which must be followed by a dump of the tree of the parsed DOM.
Each node must be represented by a single line. Each line must start with "| ",
followed by two spaces per parent node that the node has before the root
document node. The root document node doesn't have any space.

 * Element nodes must be represented by a "<", then the tag name, then "> (",
   then the element prefix, then ", ", then the element local name, then ", ",
   then the element namespace and then ")".
 * Attributes must be given, in source order, on subsequent nodes, as if they
   were children of the element node. Attribute nodes must have the attribute
   name, then an "=" sign, then the attribute value in double quotes (")
   followed by a space, then "(", then the attribute prefix, then ", ", then
   the attribute local name, then ", ", then the attribute namespace and then
   ")".
 * Text nodes must be the string, in double quotes. Newlines aren't escaped.
 * Comments must be "<!-- " then the data then " -->".
 * DOCTYPEs must be XXX
